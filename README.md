# Music is all you need to Analyze Data
## Sonification using Deep Learning Techniques
### Sonification using LSTM
__________________________________________________________________________________
Sonification is a technique of using non-speech audio to convey information or perceptualize data. It helps the listeners distinguish between the enormous amount of data and the relations between the different sets of values. Auditory perception has various parameters like amplitude, spatial, temporal and frequency resolution, which can be used as an alternative or complement to the existing visualization techniques. <br /> <br />
This repository contains the code and data used in our final project for MM811 Multimedia Topic I: AI in Multimedia. Our goal was to generate music which will follow the data which we have analyze from any time series dataset. 

### Project
_______________________________________________________________________________________________
This is PyTorch based project intended to analyze data using music.
